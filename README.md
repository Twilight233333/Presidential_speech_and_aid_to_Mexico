## Question
I aim to investigate the discourse of the U.S. President regarding Mexico and its relationship with U.S. economic aid to Mexico. Specifically, I'm interested in examining whether there is a dissonance, such as instances where the U.S. President frequently criticizes Mexico while still providing substantial aid, or instances where U.S. President uses positive language towards Mexico without evident impact on economic assistance. Additionally, I seek to delve deeper into studying the U.S. President's attitudes towards Mexico across various domains and explore how these varied attitudes influence U.S. assistance to Mexico and the overall international relations between the two countries.

## Data
I used speech data from the [UCSB Presidency Project](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/) to capture speeches since 2001 and filter out those **News conference** which mentioned **Mexico** to create a corpus. The corpus contain four presidents' 105 speech.

## Methods
I will first use **Counting Words & Phrases to Trace the Distribution of Meaning** to explore the president attitude to Mexico through time, I will use **Clustering & Topic Modeling to Discover Higher-Order Patterns of Meaning** to try to find clusters and how topic changed though time, I will use **Machine Learning to Classify and Relate Meanings** to help me label and classify president attitude for those sentences mentioned Mexico from my manual label. If it is feasible, I will use **Deep Learning to Perform Causal Inference** to explore more on my president corpus.
